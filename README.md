## Overview
ESP-Control-Platform is a powerful IoT solution built using **ESPexpress**, a backend framework for C++, and **Next.js** for the frontend interface. This platform allows seamless communication between an ESP device and a web-based control panel.

## Getting Started
### 1. Upload the Project to ESP
- Flash the ESP device with the backend code.
- Open the Serial Monitor to retrieve the device’s IP address.

### 2. Connect the Frontend
- Use the IP address from the ESP to configure the Next.js frontend.
- Ensure both the ESP device and the frontend are on the same network.

## Features
- **Real-time communication** between ESP and the web interface.
- **REST API support** for interacting with ESP hardware.
- **Modular and scalable architecture** for easy expansion.
- **Modern UI** using Next.js for a smooth experience.
